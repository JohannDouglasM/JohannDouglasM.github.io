            When I was an Informatics undergrad I couldn't stand the boring lectures, uninspiring professors and the cramming for exams.
            If I had been better organized or covid had hit later I might have found a working system like studying the material on my own and skipping the boring lectures.
            <br>
            <br>
            I dropped out because I thought with enough motivation I could learn everything important on my own.
            But easy access to dopamine and the realization that I cared more about my social life, working out and girls than programming stopped me from getting a university level education.
            While I still had wonderful years full of learning and novel experiences I still feel I have wasted time and am behind where I should be.
